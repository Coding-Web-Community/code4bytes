Welcome @Challenger's to the 12th #code4bytes challenge!
As we all know, it has been a while since the last challenge (that's my bad).
Because of this I will re-explain part of the code4bytes challenge system.

One should solve the challenge below on their own accord and without complete external help (Googling is allowed, but don't google the main question.)
Spoiling the questions for others by sharing the solution is also strictly forbidden!
Cheating or foul play will result in a permanent disqualification (No exceptions and no appeals!)

Once you have solved the question/problem you send me (@Mathis) a DM containing your code (in a file, embed, pastebin, replit or github gist).
For compiled languages, I will do the compiling myself (for obvious reasons.) After this, the code will be tested against a whole range of test cases.
If your code was successful in solving the problem, you will receive the bytes. If not you might receive some feedback about which test cases failed so you can try again. (I won't help you in any other way, because that wouldn't be fair towards other competitors.)

```
Given two strings S and T, write some code to determine if S is an anagram of T.
You can always assume the length of S and T are always greater than 0 and lowercase only!

Because of the test cases your program needs to take in 2 command line arguments and print out if they are anagrams as "True" or "False" (as shown in the examples)!
```

Examples:
```
S: vile, T: evil -> True

Would be run as (for example):
$python3 challenge12.py vile evil
True
```
```
S: mathis, T: golang -> False

Would be run as (for example):
$node challenge12.js mathis golang
False
```
```
S: serbia, T: rabies -> True

Would be run as (for example):
$./challenge12 serbia rabies
True
```

- 1st place: 500.000 bytes!
- 2nd place: 300.000 bytes!
- 3rd place: 150.000 bytes!
- Runner up: 75.000 bytes!

Extra info:
- If you have questions about the challenge ask them in #coding-general and NOT in DM's!
- This is a challenge supposed to be fun for everybody (including me) so have go out there and have fun!
- Good luck and have fun, you can do it!
