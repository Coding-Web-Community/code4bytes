**Hello everybody!** Welcome to the **6th** #code4bytes challenge.
As requested, a handcrafted actual coding challenge.
Today we'll be reading *"Steve Jobs" by Walter Isaacson*. One of my favorite books.
Your task is to read it very carefully so you don't disregard facts that are in this book ;).
```
What are the 15 most frequent words in steve.txt (attached to post)?

For example:
"The goal was never to beat the competition, or to make a lot of money. It was to do the greatest thing possible, or even a little greater."

The top 3 most frequent words would be:
[the', 'to', 'was']
[3, 3, 2]
```
**Extra tip:**
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz are the **only** valid characters. Spaces, commas and newlines don't count!

- 1st place: 400 points!
- 2nd place: 300 points!
- 3rd place: 200 points!
- Runner up: 100 points!

**Extra challenge:**
If you write your solution in a language that is not Python or JS, you get 100 points extra!

Good luck, have fun and happy coding!

PS: read the book.
