Welcome to the third #code4bytes challenge!
We find ourselves in the city of Rome, you are working as a historian in a museum and are tasked with converting roman numerals (I, V, X,...) to arabic numerals (1,2,3,4,5,...). For your convenience, an intern has typed in all the roman numerals into a text file (`roman_numerals.txt`) separated by commas. Your boss asked you to manually convert them but fortunately enough you've been hanging around in the *CodingWeb* server where you met some good people who taught you a thing or two about coding, so you think you can automate this boring task!
```
Read the roman numerals from roman_numerals.txt and convert them into arabic numerals.
What is the total sum of those arabic numerals?

Example:
I, II, III, IV, V

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
```
This challenge is quite a bit easier than the previous ones. Because of this, the first place shal recieve 500 bytes, second place 400, thrid 300 and everybody else 200. 

Have fun, good luck and happy coding!
