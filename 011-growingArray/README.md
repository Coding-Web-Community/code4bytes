Welcome @challenger's to the 11th #code4bytes challenge!. Sorry for the long delay, but there was some *personal* stuff taking away my time which made me unable to come up with new challenges.
```
Given an array, figure out if the first derivative is strictly positive or not

[1, 3, 7, 15, 27, 44, 63, 86, 107, 134, 168]
```
*Example:*
`[2, 4, 7, 13]`
**true**
`[3, 10, 15, 21]`
**false**

- 1st place: 2000 bytes!
- 2nd place: 1500 bytes!
- 3rd place: 1200 bytes!
- Runner up: 750 bytes!

*Extra info*
Using a library or function like numpy and doing `numpy.gradient()` does not count.
