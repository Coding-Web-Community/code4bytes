Welcome @Challengers to the 9th #code4bytes challenge!
Today's challenge is quite an easy one, so it's a good one to start off with if you're just getting into this.
```
You are given an array which represents the height of a mountain area.
Find the index of all the mountain tops.

Plateaus do not count!

[9, 8, 8, 7, 9, 8, 10, 9, 11, 10, 10, 9, 9, 8, 10, 7, 11, 8, 12, 9, 11, 10, 10, 9, 9, 8, 8, 9, 7, 8, 6]

Example:
[7, 6, 8, 5, 7, 4, 6, 5, 5, 6, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 5, 8, 6, 7, 7, 6, 6, 5, 5, 6, 4, 5, 3, 6, 2] 
Solution:
[2, 4, 6, 9, 15, 17, 25, 27, 29]
```
- 1st place: 3000 points!
- 2nd place: 2000 points!
- 3rd place: 1500 points!
