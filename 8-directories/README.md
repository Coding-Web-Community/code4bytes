Welcome @challengers to the 8th #code4bytes challenge!
Today's challenge has to do with lots of directories!
```
In the challenge zip, you'll find a directory called dir. In dir you'll find more directories, in which there are more directories, and more, and more.
Each folder has 0-10 other folders inside it, the maximum folder depth is 6 (dir included). At each end (deepest directory) you'll find a file with a 10 character string.
Your goal is to traverse all these folders and add all those strings together. Because Discord doesn't allow you to easily send 75030 characters (hint hint), send me the string hashed in sha256 instead. Making the hashing algorithm isn't part of the challenge.
Because theres some diffirences in OS's and languages, you need to traverse the folders as if they were listed alphabethically.
In example.zip I provided a directory with which you can test your code out. 
The outcome string of which is: tpycidujsgxhqprnxepjpxcuminusp (test this out manually so you see what I mean by alpabethically.)
And the hashed string being: a9bf2fc9978f08c8afeb2d3565179d4657f7e22fd0acf80f38e3831d3d331a5e
```
*Extra tip:*
The names of the txt files have nothing to do with the content! Don't mistake them for eachother!

- 1st place: 400 points!
- 2nd place: 300 points!
- 3rd place: 200 points!
- Runner up: 100 points!

**Extra Challenges:**
- If you write your solution in a language that is not Python or JS, you get 100 points extra!
- If your traversing algorithm is written recursively, you get 200 points extra!
