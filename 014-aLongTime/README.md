Welcome @Challengers to the 14th #code4bytes challenge!

I'm kinda sick so I don't have the energy to come up with a story as to why we're doing what we're doing like I usually do, so let's get right into it!

You are given a file called `time.log`. Each line of that file contains **2 timestamps** (*1 timestamp combination*) and **1 unique code**.
The codes are merely there to make grading a lot easier, consider them an *ID* to each timestamp!
You may assume the first timestamp is **always** earlier (smaller if converted to UNIX time code) than the second timestamp.
Here are your challenges:

```
Find the code of the timestamp combination with the smallest delta.
```
```
Find the code of the timestamp combination with the largest delta.
```
```
Find the code of the timestamp combination which is closest to the average of all the timestamp deltas.
```

To this post I have also attached a file called `example_time.log`. This is where you can verify if your code works!
Here are the results of running my code against that file:
```
shortest code:  XHtGpBzBcz
longest code:  HNUKalXyRW
code closest to average:  lHrAwUQAmJ
```

- 1st place: 500.000 bytes!
- 2nd place: 300.000 bytes!
- 3rd place: 150.000 bytes!
- Runner up: 75.000 bytes!

Good luck, have fun and don't cheat!
