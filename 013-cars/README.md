Welcome @Challengers to the **13th** #code4bytes challenge!

Today we are roleplaying as veteran data scientists for the website called "automobiletrader.com". Our bosses have asked us to do some fine research into the cars that are currenly for sale on our website! Our friendly data engineering colleagues have given us a zip called `database_files.zip`, that contains the same data in 3 diffirent formats (because data engineers are so thoughtful and sweet!). Your task is to inspect the data, figure out a good table schema, import that data into a database and then answer the following 3 challenges the CEO had for us.

```
Challenge 1:

Come up with a single SQL statement that gives us the price, model and year for every car of the ford brand.
```
```
Challenge 2:

Come up with a single SQL statement that gives us the average mileage/price (mpp) per color of car.
```
```
Challenge 3:

Come up with a single SQL statement that gives us the mean price and the standard deviation of the price of cars in California
```
**Sumbit your 3 separate SQL files! Not the results of them!**

Download the zip file here: https://frenchgirls.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/database_files.zip

- 1st place: 500.000 bytes!
- 2nd place: 300.000 bytes!
- 3rd place: 150.000 bytes!
- Runner up: 75.000 bytes!

If you cannot complete all challenges, no worries. But I'll have to dock some of your bytes! Unless you completed all challenges, you can not submit for first, second or third place (but you can for runner up!). We will also deduct 25.000 bytes per challenge you did not do!

Good luck and have fun!
