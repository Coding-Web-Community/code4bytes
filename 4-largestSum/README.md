Hello everybody! I present to you the 4th #code4bytes challenge!
Sorry for the delay, but I've been very busy lately.
```
Given an integer called s and an array of integers called x, find the index of the 2 integers in x which sum up precisely to s.

s = 19
x = [4,5,8,10,4,2,8,12,8,1,9,3]

Example:
s = 4
x = [1,2,3,5]
Solution: 0, 2

Example:
s = 10
x = [3,4,2,6,5]

Solution: 1, 3
```
As per usual, you will need to share your code and not just the answer. Because I'm sure we're all smart enough to calculate it by hand ;).
I will use your code to test it on some hidden testcase so write it robustly. Minimum array x length is 2, minimum int s value is 0.

- 1st place: 400 points!
- 2nd place: 300 points!
- 3rd place: 200 points!
- Runner up: 100 points!

**Extra Challenge**
Try doing it in a single pass. So no double pointers!
If done this way, you get 100 points extra!

Have fun, good luck and happy coding!
