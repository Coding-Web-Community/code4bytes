dear parents, friends and family of elemental. i am sending you this letter to inform you that he is fine. besides a couple scratches he is doing better than ever. we have give    n him some steroids and a bench press. he has a massive 6 pack now. if you ever wanna see him like this alive, pay us 100k in bytes asap. do not call the police or we will make him liste    n to country music legends such as toby keith, hank williams and dolly parton! you know damn well he doesn't like that and will most likely not survive.
