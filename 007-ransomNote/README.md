Welcome to the 7th #code4bytes challenge! 
Today we kidnapped @Elemental and we're writing a ransom note to his parents, telling them they need to give us 100.000 bytes in order for us to release him.
In true movie fashion, we're going to make our ransom note using some magazines, a pair of scissors and a gluestick. To save you some trouble, I already wrote a ransom letter. The only thing you need to do is check if we can make it using the magazines we have at hand.
```
Given a string of letters (the magazines) and a another string (the ransom note), write a function that will tell us if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines or not.

Example:
"a", "b" -> True
"aa", "ab" -> False
"aa", "aab" -> True
```
*extra tip:*
spaces do not count! commas and other punctuations do!

You can find the ransom note and the magazine attached to this post.

**Extra Challenges:**
- If you can't make the ransom note, tell me which characters are missing and howmuch and you get 50 points extra!
- If you write your solution in a language that is not Python or JS, you get 100 points extra!
- If you write it in golang you get 300 points extra ;)

Good luck, have fun and happy coding!!

Obligatory disclaimer: we didn't actually kidnap elemental. Nor does he have a sixpack. Although he should listen to Toby Keith for once.
