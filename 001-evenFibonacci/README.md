Hello everybody! Welcome to the first #code4bytes challenge! Because this is our first challenge, I'd like to keep things quite easy! So here is the challenge: 

```
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```

As you can see this is easily bruteforcable, but try to come up with a solution that doesn't compute every number in the fibonacci sequence. Hint: try to analyze the sequence to see if you can skip certain calculations.

If you're done, DM your solution along with the code and a screenshot of your terminal/cmd as stated by @EmotionIce. If we feel as though you might not have written it yourself we might as some questions about it to see if you really came up with it yourself! So dont cheat! Good luck and happy coding!
